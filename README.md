# Crypto_Clusters

This is a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes unsupervised learning using K clusters and PCA data predictions. The crypto clusters application is used to observe the performance of cryptocurrency clusters trhoughout different time periods; which are then plotted on a graph to visually represent it.
